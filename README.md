This is an app I designed for an assignment in the past, simulates a "2D rubiks cube" written in Java


 ## HOW TO DOWNLOAD 
  1. Download and install Android Studio
  2. Download the GitHub repository **magic_cube_app-master.zip** and extract it
  3. Open Android Studio and select **Import Project** and select the extracted folder
  4. Here you can go in the top toolbar, go to **Build->Build Bundle(s) / APK(s)->Build APK(s)**
  5. Then you can find the APK file under **\app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk**
  6. Alternatively you can run it on the Android studio emulator, by selecting **Make Project** (green hammer icon) and then **Run** (green play icon) (Use the **Pixel 3a XL, API 30** AVD for best results)
